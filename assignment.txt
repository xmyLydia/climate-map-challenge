1. The bug I found is located in App.js: in line 52, latitude and longitude are stored in wrong order,
   it should be  const [lat, lon] = loc.info.position.map(parseFloat);
2. I added 3 features on the user interacton, it can be checked by PNG files under ./result directory: 
   (1) Marker Map: it basically shows the location with blue marker, when user clicks the marker, 
       real-time and detailed information will pop up, such as climate, snow depth, location name, time
   (2) Heat Map: I used the heatMap component in order to visualize the climate difference clearly, 
	   heat map is able to show user which part is colder, which location is warmer.
   (3) Charts: When user click charts, there will be 3 charts shown about the real-time analysis： 
           a) First is pie chart, I analysis the climate from latest record:
	      partition those records to -40℃~-30℃,-30℃~-20℃,-20℃~-10℃,-10℃~-0℃, >0℃,
	      it shows the proportion of different temperature zones in the pie chart.
	      Analysis result such as: result shows 72.46% locations' climate is -20℃~-10℃, no location's climate is higher than 0℃ 
	   b) Second one is Climate Bar Chart, it directly shows the difference for different locations on climate recorded on the latest                 hour.
	      Such as: Kemijärven pienlentokenttä has the lowest climate: -33.2℃, Maarianhamina Länsisatama has highest climate: -4.9℃
	   c) Third one is line chart, I analysised 5 locations snow depth on that day, and shown them with stacked area map.
	      Such as: It shows that Lohja Porla has max snow depth among those 5 locations, which is 38 mm
3. What can be improved: I think if I go deeper, data analysis such as clustering, it can be used to find out which locatios are more similar to each other.
   Also more functions and interesting user interactions can be applied. 
   Thank you for providing this chance to exercise me and also, I have learned many new things during this challenge.
